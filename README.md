# PokemonFinder

<img align="right" src="./src/assets/pokemon_finder_demo.gif" height="600"/>

### Mobile app that lets you search for pokemon by name or id.

The main purpose of this app is to research the use of [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) with [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) for the REST API mocking purposes in tests.

Note that since [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) does not execute in a browser environment, you cannot run a Service Worker alongside your application. You can use MSW with React Native only for NodeJS integration.

## Prerequisites
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >=16.x
- [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) environment

## Created with the help of the awesome 
- [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) environment
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) the Pok√©mon API
- [RTK Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) fetching and caching tool
- [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) API mocking of the next generation
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Native Testing Library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/) unit test assertions
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) static type checker
